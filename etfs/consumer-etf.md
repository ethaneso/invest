# Consumer ETF

At present, the standard of global industry classification divides the consumer sector into two categories, namely

* **Consumer** Essentials, English Consumer Staples.
* **Optional consumer goods**, English Consumer Discretionary.

Essential consumer goods, generally refer to daily life must be used, such as food, beverages, cosmetics, dish soap, etc., these are easy to consume, need to buy from time to time, do not buy can not.\
\
Optional consumer goods, mainly durable consumer goods and luxury goods, such as televisions and cars rarely break, clothes are rarely broken, Starbucks, McDonald's, hotels and movie theaters do not necessarily have to go.\
\
Thus:

* The demand for optional consumption is relatively weak, because the demand for optional consumption is not as stable as that of the main consumption, and if the economic situation is not good, consumers will tend to postpone optional consumption or choose cheaper products. But optional consumption also shows a stronger cyclicality. Like household appliances, like the automotive industry, there will be stronger performance cycle fluctuations.
* Optional consumption has the characteristics of upgrading, which is in stark contrast to the main consumption. We do not have any requirements for the upgrading of major consumer products such as cola, oil, salt, sauce and vinegar, and cigarettes, and the salt we eat today is not much different from that of more than a decade ago. But every once in a while, the products that can be consumed are upgraded. For example, the three major pieces in the 80s and the color TVs in the 90s have representative optional consumer products in each era.

\
For investments:

* Must consumer goods stocks, most of them are giants with many years of history, these giants have a high moat, but the growth rate is not easy to say, and the general ten-year doubling problem is not big. The famous representative is Procter & GamblePGcoca colaKO, WalmartWMT。
* Non-essential consumer goods stocks, because of the cyclicality, so the trend of individual stocks is quite different, if you choose to meet the needs of the times of high-quality growth stocks, then the yield will not be amazing, such as with the rise of the Internet Netflix (stock NFLX), sleep Number Corporation (stock) that started by mattresses ( stocks SNBR), are all classic examples of about a hundred times from the lowest point in 2008 to today.

\
In addition, it is worth mentioning that in the e-commerce category, e-commerce sales include both optional consumer goods and non-essential consumer goods, so most of them will be classified as non-optional consumption.\
\
Next, a few ETFs are introduced, and their liquidity is certainly no problem, and the management fee is also very low.
